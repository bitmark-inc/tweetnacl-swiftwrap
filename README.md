# TweetNacl
[TweetNaCl](http://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to) wrapper, written in Swift

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bitmark-inc/tweetnacl-swiftwrap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bitmark-inc/tweetnacl-swiftwrap) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/bitmark-inc/tweetnacl-swiftwrap/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/bitmark-inc/tweetnacl-swiftwrap)

## Requirements
- iOS 9.0+ / macOS 10.10+ / tvOS 9.0+ / watchOS 2.0+
- Xcode 12.0+
- Swift 5.0+

## Installation

### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.1+ is required to build TweetNacl 1.0+.

To integrate TweetNacl into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'TweetNacl', '~> 1.0.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate TweetNacl into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "bitmark-inc/tweetnacl-swiftwrap" ~> 1.0
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `TweetNacl.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but TweetNacl does support its use on supported platforms. 

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding TweetNacl as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .Package(url: "https://github.com/bitmark-inc/tweetnacl-swiftwrap.git", majorVersion: 1)
]
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate TweetNacl into your project manually.

#### Embedded Framework

- Open up Terminal, `cd` into your top-level project directory, and run the following command "if" your project is not initialized as a git repository:

  ```bash
  $ git init
  ```

- Add TweetNacl as a git [submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) by running the following command:

  ```bash
  $ git submodule add https://github.com/bitmark-inc/tweetnacl-swiftwrap.git
  ```

- Open the new `TweetNacl` folder, and drag the `TweetNacl.xcodeproj` into the Project Navigator of your application's Xcode project.

    > It should appear nested underneath your application's blue project icon. Whether it is above or below all the other Xcode groups does not matter.

- Select the `TweetNacl.xcodeproj` in the Project Navigator and verify the deployment target matches that of your application target.
- Next, select your application project in the Project Navigator (blue project icon) to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the "Targets" heading in the sidebar.
- In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the "General" panel.
- Click on the `+` button under the "Embedded Binaries" section.
- You will see two different `TweetNacl.xcodeproj` folders each with two different versions of the `TweetNacl.framework` nested inside a `Products` folder.

    > It does not matter which `Products` folder you choose from, but it does matter whether you choose the top or bottom `TweetNacl.framework`.

- Select the top `TweetNacl.framework` for iOS and the bottom one for OS X.

    > You can verify which one you selected by inspecting the build log for your project. The build target for `TweetNacl` will be listed as either `TweetNacl-iOS`, `TweetNacl-macOS`, `TweetNacl-tvOS` or `TweetNacl-watchOS`.

- And that's it!

  > The `TweetNacl.framework` is automagically added as a target dependency, linked framework and embedded framework in a copy files build phase which is all you need to build on the simulator and a device.

## Usage
All API functions accept and return [Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/data).

### Public-key authenticated encryption (box)

Implements *curve25519-xsalsa20-poly1305*.

#### NaclBox.keyPair()

Generates a new random key pair for box and returns it as an object with
`publicKey` and `secretKey` members:

    {
       publicKey: ...,  // Data with 32-byte public key
       secretKey: ...   // Data with 32-byte secret key
    }


#### NaclBox.keyPair(fromSecretKey:)

Returns a key pair for box with public key corresponding to the given secret
key.

#### NaclBox.box(message, nonce, theirPublicKey, mySecretKey)

Encrypt and authenticates message using peer's public key, our secret key, and
the given nonce, which must be unique for each distinct message for a key pair.

#### NaclBox.open(box, nonce, theirPublicKey, mySecretKey)

Authenticates and decrypts the given box with peer's public key, our secret
key, and the given nonce.

Returns the original message, or `false` if authentication fails.

#### NaclBox.before(theirPublicKey, mySecretKey)

Returns a precomputed shared key which can be used in `NaclBox.after` and
`NaclBox.open.after`.

#### NaclBox.after(message, nonce, sharedKey)

Same as `NaclBox`, but uses a shared key precomputed with `NaclBox.before`.

#### NaclBox.open.after(box, nonce, sharedKey)

Same as `NaclBox.open`, but uses a shared key precomputed with `NaclBox.before`.

#### NaclBox.publicKeyLength = 32

Length of public key in bytes.

#### NaclBox.secretKeyLength = 32

Length of secret key in bytes.

#### NaclBox.sharedKeyLength = 32

Length of precomputed shared key in bytes.

#### NaclBox.nonceLength = 24

Length of nonce in bytes.

#### NaclBox.overheadLength = 16

Length of overhead added to box compared to original message.


### Secret-key authenticated encryption (secretbox)

Implements *xsalsa20-poly1305*.

#### NaclSecretBox.secretBox(message, nonce, key)

Encrypt and authenticates message using the key and the nonce. The nonce must
be unique for each distinct message for this key.

Returns an encrypted and authenticated message.

#### NaclSecretBox.open(box, nonce, key)

Authenticates and decrypts the given secret box using the key and the nonce.

Returns the original message, or `false` if authentication fails.

#### NaclSecretBox.keyLength = 32

Length of key in bytes.

#### NaclSecretBox.nonceLength = 24

Length of nonce in bytes.

#### NaclSecretBox.overheadLength = 16

Length of overhead added to secret box compared to original message.


### Scalar multiplication

Implements [e25519](http://ed25519.cr.yp.to).

#### NaclScalarMult(n, p)

Multiplies an integer `n` by a group element `p` and returns the resulting
group element.

#### NaclScalarMult.base(n)

Multiplies an integer `n` by a standard group element and returns the resulting
group element.

#### NaclScalarMult.scalarLength = 32

Length of scalar in bytes.

#### NaclScalarMult.groupElementLength = 32

Length of group element in bytes.


### Signatures

Implements [ed25519](http://ed25519.cr.yp.to).

#### NaclSign.keyPair()

Generates new random key pair for signing and returns it as an object with
`publicKey` and `secretKey` members:

    {
       publicKey: ...,  // Data with 32-byte public key
       secretKey: ...   // Data with 64-byte secret key
    }

#### NaclSign.keyPair.fromSecretKey(secretKey)

Returns a signing key pair with public key corresponding to the given
64-byte secret key. The secret key must have been generated by
`NaclSign.KeyPair` or `NaclSign.KeyPair.fromSeed`.

#### NaclSign.keyPair.fromSeed(seed)

Returns a new signing key pair generated deterministically from a 32-byte seed.
The seed must contain enough entropy to be secure. This method is not
recommended for general use: instead, use `NaclSign.KeyPair` to generate a new
key pair from a random seed.

#### NaclSign(message, secretKey)

Signs the message using the secret key and returns a signed message.

#### NaclSign.open(signedMessage, publicKey)

Verifies the signed message and returns the message without signature.

Returns `nil` if verification failed.

#### NaclSign.detached(message, secretKey)

Signs the message using the secret key and returns a signature.

#### NaclSign.detached.verify(message, signature, publicKey)

Verifies the signature for the message and returns `true` if verification
succeeded or `false` if it failed.

#### NaclSign.publicKeyLength = 32

Length of signing public key in bytes.

#### NaclSign.secretKeyLength = 64

Length of signing secret key in bytes.

#### NaclSign.seedLength = 32
